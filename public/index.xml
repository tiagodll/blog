      <description>did I run my migrations? Today I had an error message driving me crazy:
method_missing&#39;: undefined method export_format&#39; for XXX model
You see, our model is a gem itself, because it is shared by several projects. When we have something in the schema that is not in the database, that is the error we get.
Now, I knew this error from previous executions, but my model was in synch with the DB.</description>
