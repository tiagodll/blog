To start with, I'll explain why I am creating this blog. Maybe you know my old blog. It is dead now.
It was in my old server and I decided not to keep it, but what makes me mad is the domain. it expired and now I don't even have email.
Anyway, new blog, new posts, new life.
I don't hate java anymore, yay!
Just kidding... I still do.
But not as much.
You see, now the servlets seems to work. The IDEs are decent. And java is so far behind .Net, they don't even try to compete anymore... Maybe that's the best part.
So this is my first...ish post... at least the first in this blog.
