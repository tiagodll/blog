# God dammit ubuntu!

I have to start by admitting one thing: I use to hate servers. Every time I even had to open a remote connection, that would ruin my mood. Granted, I am a web developer, my work depends on it. But stillâ€¦

All that is just to explain why I havenâ€™t updated my ancient server for a few years

Ok, time to roll up myâ€¦ well, I donâ€™t really wear long sleevesâ€¦ Anyway, I take a deep breath and try to upgrade it.

```bash
sudo do-release-upgrade
```

[Enter]

```bash
Reading cache

Checking package manager

Cannot upgrade 

An upgrade from 'zesty' to 'bionic' is not supported with this tool.

Ooops Apparently this upgrading tool doesnâ€™t support my version anymore

I tried ducking around (yes, I use duck duck go), but none of the results was working for me

Got in contact with scaleway and they said: - ubuntu is only upgradeable for 2 major versions. Now you have to destroy your instance, and make a new one.

Dammit, now I will have a new instance with new price. My old instance was super cheap because it was that old.

Ok, it was my fault. I will not complain. lets go!

So I got my new instance and started working on it:

1. Create my own user & secure it
2. install and configure nginx and certbot
3. install docker
4. git clone my apps, run devops script
5. spend days and days fixingâ€¦

â€¦ wait a minute â€¦

it works! ðŸ˜Ž

But wait, how is this working? ðŸ¤”

it took me months to set up the old server

Simple:

You see, the old server I had to set up app by app

but when I got 2 more developers to work on my side project, I decided to have it all running on docker, so it would be easy to have it working for everyone

I was expecting it would be easier, but having it all working in minutes was unbelievable.
