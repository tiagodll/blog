There is something about hardware/low level development that amazes me.
I am not really good at it, I don't actually want to be, my relation with hardware is the same I have with sports: I love to learn new sports, practice it a little bit, but when it starts to get too competitive, ie, the guys are getting serious about it, I loose interest.

That being said, I have to say I've played a lot with this things.
The first one was the pic. I friend of mine(electric engineer) helped me to get started and to like it.
The next step was to upgrade(or is it downgrade?) to arduino, a platform much easier than pic, and that comes ready for development.
I got a lot of fun with that, but then when I've moved to london, I brought just the essential, so it was left behind.

But when I read about the new raspberry pi, got all excited again!
I would be finally able to create high level code and run it in a computer with the size of a credit card.
Then you ask: but master, how can I do that???

Simple little grasshopper, you just have to have a pi and a little patience.
step1: install ruby;
step2: install sinatra;
step3: install node.js, and this is the tricky one, I had no idea it was needed...
run your code and GG!

Now, making your rasp visible to the outer world... that is for another post.
ps: It involves changing your router settings, and that.... that is enough to make me sad...
